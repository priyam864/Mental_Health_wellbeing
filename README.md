## 🌟 Project Overview
Mental health is an essential aspect of human well-being, especially for students who face academic, social, and personal challenges. This project explores mental health trends among students aged 18–32 using survey data and provides actionable insights through data visualization and warehousing techniques. The goal is to promote awareness, reduce stigma, and suggest interventions for improved mental well-being.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Survey Analysis**: Insights from mental health survey data, including anxiety levels, coping mechanisms, and emotional openness.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards created in Power BI.
- **Data Warehousing**: Leveraged Google BigQuery for scalable data storage and analysis.
- **Predictive Insights**: Trends and patterns identified to guide mental health programs in education and workplaces.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python, VBA (Excel Macros)
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI
- **Data Storage**: Google BigQuery
- **Other Tools**: Microsoft Excel, Google Forms

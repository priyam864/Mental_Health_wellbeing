## How to Use This Repository

### 1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI Desktop**.
   - Set up a **Google BigQuery project** with the necessary permissions.

### 2. **Run ETL Operations**
   - Open the `MentalHealth_Survey_Raw.xlsx` file in Excel.
   - Use the `RenameColumns.vba` script to standardize column names.
   - Save the cleaned data as `MentalHealth_Cleaned.csv`.

### 3. **Data Loading into BigQuery**
   - Use the `star_schema_creation.sql` script to define the schema in BigQuery.
   - Import the `MentalHealth_Cleaned.csv` file into the appropriate fact and dimension tables.

### 4. **Data Visualization in Power BI**
   - Launch the `MentalHealthDashboard.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.
   - Connect the dashboard to your BigQuery project.
   - Interact with the dashboard to uncover meaningful insights.

## Key Results and Insights
1. **Higher Anxiety Levels in Younger Students**: Students aged 18–25, particularly in high-stress academic fields, reported elevated anxiety levels.
2. **Positive Impact of Physical Activity and Family Support**: Regular exercise and strong family support were strongly associated with better mental health.
3. **Workload and Stress Correlation**: Heavy academic workloads were a major driver of anxiety and reduced mental well-being.
4. **The Role of Community and Peer Networks**: Students with access to supportive peer networks and communities reported lower stress levels and better overall mental health.

## Future Enhancements
- Broadening the dataset to cover more diverse demographics, including variations in age, geography, and academic disciplines.
- Implementing advanced machine learning techniques to predict mental health trends and patterns.
- Automating data pipelines for real-time integration and analysis of incoming survey responses.

# Mental Health Wellbeing Analysis (DVP Project)

This project focuses on analyzing mental health data, including aspects like anxiety, stress, coping mechanisms, and emotional well-being. It explores various insights derived from the dataset and offers data visualizations and dashboards for a better understanding of mental health trends.

## 📂 Datasets
- **Source**: Data was collected through Google Forms, capturing responses on anxiety, stress, coping mechanisms, and emotional well-being.
- **Processing**: Raw data was cleaned, transformed, and normalized using Excel (VBA) and Python.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Younger individuals (18–25 years) experience higher anxiety levels due to academic and career pressures.
- Physical activity, balanced diets, and social support correlate positively with mental well-being.
- Female participants report higher anxiety, while male participants have higher substance use.
- Regular sleep patterns significantly improve mental health ratings.
